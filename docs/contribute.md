## Claim your task

Before you start to write any code, please check if the component / functionality you want to implement already exists. If not, follow the following steps:

* Go to [the Tasklist on Notion](https://www.notion.so/jkgroup/shared-bits-48e37099b91240acb11dc487e3101068?pvs=4).
* If the functionality you want to implement is listed, claim it.
* If the functionality is not listed, make a request in the `#circle-frontend` channel to see if interest is there. If there is, it will be added to the Notion-Tasklist. Once added you can claim the task.

## Create the functionality

Implement your functionality while keeping to the [guidelines](./guidelines.md).

## Create a Merge-Request
Once implemented, please create a `Merge Request` on Gitlab from your branch to `master`. Set `Elias Bernhaut` and `Patrick Stillhart` (TODO: Check reviewer list) as reviewers.
